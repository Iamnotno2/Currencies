```python
Would you like to see the supported currencies list first (Yes/No)
```
- If the input is "Yes", then the program will show the supported currencies list. In case "No" is selected then the program will prompt following message:-
```python
Input Currency:
```
- If the user inputs valid currency. The rate of the currency will be shown:-
```python
Input Currency: PKR
278.231207
```
- In case the user inputs invalid currency. Following message will be prompted, and the user will be asked to input again

- The user will be asked to input first currency, such as:-
```python
Input First Currency: USD
```
- Incase the user inputs invalid currency, the program will prompt the user to input the first currency again. In case the user inputs valid currency, the program will ask for the value of first currency. The value can be an int or a float:-
```python
Input First Currency Value: 25.5
```
- Incase the user inputs invalid value, the program will prompt the user to input first currency value again. In case the user inputs valid value, the program will ask for the second currency in which the value of first currency is to be converted:-
```python
Input Second Currency: PKR
```
- Incase the user inputs invalid currency, the program will prompt user to input the second currency again. In case the user inputs valid currency, the program will convert the value of first currency into the equivalant value of second currency. The output would be as under:-
```python
25.5 USD to PKR = 7094.90 PKR
```




## FAQ üôã

#### Are the Currency Rates live?

Currency Rates are live for which [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com) has been used. However, the authenticity of these cannot be confirmed.

#### What is the First Currency and Second Currency in Currency Converter

First Currency is the major currency whose value is to be converted into the equivalent value of Second Currency.

#### My program is not working properly. It is giving following error:-
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tabulate'
```


Install the required modules as per the pip install command. In this case before running the program execute following command in the terminal:-
```python
pip install tabulate
```
